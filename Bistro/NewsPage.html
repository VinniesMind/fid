<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>posted by BGB, <time datetime="2024-11-15">November 15, 2024</time></p>

<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <b>sous vide</b>. In sous video cooking, you submerge the food
(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to.
In his book, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <em>November 30</em>.</p>

<p>Location: <br>Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>

<p>Hours: <br>Tuesday to Sunday, 11am to 11pm</p>
